Smart Contact Manager is a web application built using the Spring Boot framework.
================================================================================================================================================================================

Project Overview:
Smart Contact Manager is a comprehensive web application developed using the Spring Boot framework (version 3.2.2). The application offers a suite of features, empowering users to efficiently manage their contacts and ensure secure user interactions. Key functionalities include:

1. Contact Management:
Users can create, edit, and delete contact information, providing a comprehensive solution for organizing and maintaining their contact list.

2. User Account Security:
Secure user accounts are achieved through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented with Spring Security. Users can seamlessly register, log in, and manage their accounts, ensuring a safe and controlled user experience.

3. Search Functionality:
The application incorporates a powerful search feature, enabling users to quickly locate specific contacts. This functionality enhances the overall usability and efficiency of contact management.

4. Database Persistence:
Data is stored securely in a database, leveraging the capabilities of MySQL and Spring Data JPA. This ensures reliable and persistent storage of user and contact information.

5. Email Integration:
Java Mail API is seamlessly integrated into the application, allowing users to send emails. This functionality is particularly useful for features such as password recovery, ensuring a streamlined communication experience.

6. Dynamic Web Pages:
Thymeleaf, a server-side templating engine, is employed to create dynamic HTML pages. This enhances the user interface by providing a responsive and interactive experience.

**Key Technologies:**
The project utilizes key technologies to enhance its functionality and maintain a robust structure:

1. Spring Security:
Implements user authentication and authorization.

2. Spring Data JPA:
Connects to a database (likely MySQL) using JPA and Hibernate.

3. Thymeleaf:
Used for server-side templating to render dynamic HTML pages.

4. Spring Web:
Enables web application development.

5. Java Mail:
Integrates email functionalities.

6. JUnit:
Available for writing unit tests (scope="test").

**Project Structure:**
The project is organized into a well-defined structure:

1. com.smart:
Main package for the project.

2. SmartcontactmanagerApplication.java:
Main class for the Spring Boot application.

3. config:
Contains configuration classes.
CustomUserDetails.java and UserDetailsServiceImpl.java handle user authentication and authorization.
MyConfig.java might contain general configuration settings.

4. controller:
Contains controllers handling various parts of the application.
HomeController.java, SearchController.java, UserController.java, and ForgotController.java likely manage different views and user actions.

5. dao:
Data Access Object package.
ContactRepository.java and UserRepository.java are likely responsible for database interactions.

6. entities:
Contains entity classes representing the database tables.
Contact.java and User.java might represent contact and user entities, respectively.

7. helper:
Contains utility classes.
Message.java and SessionHelper.java may handle message-related functionalities and session management.

8. service:
Service layer for business logic.
EmailService.java might handle email-related functionalities.

**Templates:**
Various HTML templates are organized based on functionality and user roles:

admin:
HTML templates for admin-related views.
forget_email_form.html, home.html, login.html, password_change_form.html, signup.html, verify_otp.html:
Templates for various user-related actions.


about.html, base.html:
General templates for the about page and base structure.


admin:
Templates for admin-specific views.


user:
Templates for user-specific views.


**Password Recovery and Email Validation:**
Users who forget their passwords can initiate the recovery process through a secure sequence:

1. The ForgotController.java likely handles the forget password functionality.
2. When a user initiates password recovery, an OTP (One-Time Password) is generated and sent to their registered email address.
3. The EmailService.java class is likely involved in sending emails, and forget_email_form.html could be the associated HTML template.
4. The user receives the OTP via email and can then use it for verification.
5. The verify_otp.html template might be utilized for the OTP verification process.
6. After successful OTP verification, the user can proceed to change their password using the password_change_form.html template.
7. The UserController.java or a similar class may handle the password change process.


**Possible Functionality:**

Contact Management:
Adding, updating, and searching for contacts.

User Management:
Registration, login, and account management.

Security:
Spring Security is implemented for user authentication and authorization.

Email Functionality:
Java Mail is used, possibly for password reset or other email-related functionalities.

Security Aspects:
Security is a paramount consideration, with classes like CustomUserDetails and UserDetailsServiceImpl ensuring a secure user experience.

Templates Overview:
Various HTML templates are organized by functionality and user roles, providing a cohesive and user-friendly interface.

This comprehensive overview encapsulates the project's structure, key technologies, functionalities, and security measures. It emphasizes the project's commitment to delivering a secure, efficient, and user-friendly Smart Contact Manager application.
